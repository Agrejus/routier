    Missing
        Event Store -> Undo/Redo
        Need unit testing
        history tracking ----> Replication
        context tracking

        Can we do CDC so we can create history tables?
        Can we apply a TTL to documents?

    TODO
        Error with remove response, cannot find entity
            How do we enforce correct response?
                base class or interface?
        Fix failing tests, currently working on adds (first batch)
        Remove Proxies, change over to context tracking
            benefits?
        Make sure errors are reported correctly
        Make sure we are serializing and deserializing dates correctly in Routier
