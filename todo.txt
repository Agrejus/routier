    Missing
        Errors should terminate the operation, do not continue
        What about partial results?
            PartialResultType<T>
            Should we have transactions/retries
            Event Driven?
        Need to send in all changes at once vs by collection
            If we are dealing with a NoSql scenario where everything is stored as a key/value pair, there is no concept of tables/collections,
            we can just save everything in one shot.  Likewise, we can send the entire change package to the plugin and it can decide what to do with it
        Need unit testing
        history tracking ----> Replication
        context tracking
        Event store
        Can we move callbacks over to result pattern?
            {
                ok: true,
                result; T
            }

            {
                ok: false,
                error: any
            }

        entity changes -> updates does not need to be a map, why?
            does previewChanges need to divide out by schemaid?  Nah, just return all items



        Can we do CDC so we can create history tables?
            Can we apply a TTL to documents?

        History Records?  How can we use the replicator for this?
        DbReplicator -> Inherit and override query and bulkOperations
                        Filter for your collection
                        When Replicating, change the schema from the base to the history schema

    TODO
        _rev is not being set correctly in the example scenario
        Remove Proxies, change over to context tracking
            benefits?
        Make sure errors are reported correctly
        Make sure we are serializing and deserializing dates correctly in Routier
        Test entity tagging
