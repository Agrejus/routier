# Documentation authoring rules (AI-oriented)

## Information architecture

- Prefer top-level sections: Getting Started, Concepts, Guides, How-To, API, Integrations, Tutorials, Examples, Demos.
- Keep navigation shallow (max depth 2). Cross-link instead of nesting deeply.
- Each page must declare its role: concept, guide, how-to, or reference.

## Page templates

- Concepts: overview (2â€“3 sentences), when to use, key ideas, links to guides and API.
- Guides: goal statement, prerequisites, steps with code, pitfalls, next steps.
- How-to: one task, concise steps, minimal context, link to concept and API.
- API: purpose, signatures, params/returns, behavior notes, examples, related links.

## Writing style

- Be concise, task-first, and consistent with API naming.
- Use TypeScript by default; add JS only if valuable.
- Prefer small, runnable snippets followed by realistic examples.
- Avoid fluff, avoid passive voice, prefer imperative verbs.

## Code examples

- Use fenced code blocks with the correct language tag.
- Show the minimal working example first, then an expanded example.
- Keep snippet scopes consistent with import paths used in the repo.
- Do not include comments that explain obvious lines; add comments for why.

## Cross-linking

- Every page should link to: a related concept (if applicable) and related API.
- Concepts should link to at least one guide and one how-to.
- Avoid duplicate content; reference canonical pages instead.

## Terminology

- Match public API names exactly (functions, classes, options).
- Use consistent nouns for core ideas: collections, live queries, optimistic mutations, transactions, schema.

## Examples and demos

- Examples are code-first; demos are UX-first. Link both from relevant guides.
- Prefer incremental, copy-pasteable steps that build on each other.

## Quality checks

- No broken links. Verify local relative paths.
- Sidebar entry must exist for new top-level pages.
- Include an Edit on GitHub link if the site supports it.

## React-specific

- Prefer hooks-based examples. Show `useLiveQuery` for reading and collection mutators for writing.
- Show optimistic behavior and rollback patterns explicitly where relevant.

## Performance and errors

- For performance topics, include measurement setup and expected outcomes.
- For errors, include reproduction, cause, and recovery/rollback steps.

## Example structure sync with TanStack DB

- Getting Started: overview, installation, quick start, framework adapter.
- Concepts: collections, schemas, live queries, optimistic mutations, transactions, dataflow.
- Guides: live queries, optimistic updates, state management, syncing, history tracking, entity tagging, data manipulation.
- API: links to generated reference plus hand-written overviews.
