When generating tests, follow these best practices to ensure they are comprehensive, readable, and maintainable:

### Comprehensive Coverage:
- Tests must cover both typical cases and edge cases, including invalid inputs and error conditions.
- Consider all possible scenarios for each method or behavior and ensure they are tested.

### Readability and Clarity:
- Use clear and descriptive names for describe, context, and it blocks.
- Prefer the expect syntax for assertions to improve readability.
- Keep test code concise; avoid unnecessary complexity or duplication.
- Please do not use any comments, especially arrage/act/assert comments

### Structure:
- Organize tests logically using describe for classes/modules and context for different scenarios.
- Ensure test file paths mirror the structure of the files being tested (e.g., app/models/user.ts â†’ app/models/user.test.ts).
- Ensure tests clean up side-effects (e.g. restore mocks, clear mocks)
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern in every test
- Ensure every test has at least one expect()
- Test files should go next to the file being tested

## Test Data Management:
- Prefer factories (e.g., FactoryBot) over fixtures for creating test data.
- Please search the codebase for any existing factories that can be used

## Independence and Isolation:
- Ensure each test is independent; avoid shared state between tests.
- Use mocks to simulate calls to external services (APIs, databases) and stubs to return predefined values for specific methods. Isolate the unit being tested, but avoid over-mocking; test real behavior when possible.
- Prefer jest.mocked over jest.mock

## Avoid Repetition:
- Use shared examples for common behaviors across different contexts.
- Refactor repetitive test code into helpers or custom matchers if necessary.

## Testing Method
- If the test does not pass, do not write it to pass, please confirm that the logic is correct
- Write one test, confirm it is correct before doing the rest of the tests
- Please run added/changed tests to ensure they pass
