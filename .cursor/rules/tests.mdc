- Always use arrange/act/assert for a test
- Always assert your expectations
- Please refer to the @schemas folder to find all schemas
- Types are all infered from the schema
- If types are needed, use the exported CompiledSchema and infer it's type.  See @blogPost.ts for how a schema is constructed.  Use `InferType<typeof blogPost>` to get the infered type.
- If the key of a schema is a string always verify the type, not the value.  `expect(myModel.id).toStrictEqua(expect.any(String))`
- Refer to the @schema folder for all of the different options avalable to a schema
